# DormFinder - A Peer-Based Online Information and Rating System for Student Dormitories in UPLB
Abstract/General Summary:
	The limited mobility imposed by lockdown restrictions due to COVID-19 have made it difficult to perform face-to-face activities. With the eventual reopening of schools and universities, students in UPLB would need an avenue to scout for dormitories and lodging amidst the difficulties brought about by COVID-19. This study proposes the use of an online platform to help mitigate these difficulties. Although platforms do exist such as UPLB Housemates which help students find dorms online, information presented in this medium is cluttered and disorganized. Scouting for dorms online provides a convenience to the students, but it comes with its own problems. Unlike scouting directly face-to-face where students would be able to see the facilities in person, online platforms would have to rely on pictures uploaded by the users. Implementing rating and reviews systems could help accommodate this problem. Previous studies have found that Consumer Satisfaction Rating Systems have helped guide consumers in their decisions regarding a product.  By implementing a rating and review system, students would be given an insight on the quality that a facility could offer. A web application will be developed to give students an easy and accessible way to scout for dorms. Features of the web application include being able to create and login to accounts, add and update and establishments, and search for dorms with filters.
